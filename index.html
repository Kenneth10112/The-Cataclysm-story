A breath of fresh air, lush greenery, a nearby forest, and a foreign environment—this was what Vanessa woke up to.

“Where am I?” she murmured, confused, questioning why she was lying in an open field she didn’t recognize. She tried to stand, but a sudden surge of memories slammed into her, and she squirmed on the ground from the mental shock. Moments passed, and she eventually managed to calm herself enough to sit up instead of remaining on the ground.

“Crystals... coenubia… what the hell were those?” She muttered, piecing together fragments of the memories that assaulted her.
“Land Under Cultivation: Hill…” She blinked, trying to make sense of the words, realizing where she was. But the name struck her as odd, unfamiliar, like something was off.

She rose to her feet and walked in a direction that felt instinctively right. It was as if she had been here before—hundreds, if not thousands of times. She knew this route, knew how to leave the forest. But when she arrived at an empty clearing, only trees surrounding her, something felt very wrong.

“This isn’t right. There should be a house here.” Her voice trembled slightly, the overwhelming unease creeping up her spine. She knew, deep down, that a house had been here—she could almost picture it—but now, there was nothing.

The unease pressed on her chest, so heavy that she couldn’t shake it. Without thinking, she ran, desperate to confirm something, anything. Her heart raced as she reached the place in her mind, but instead of finding the familiar sight of a castle, what lay before her was a desolate wasteland.

“El Scaro...” She whispered to herself, staring at the empty land where the castle should’ve been. The name, the place—it all clicked, and a chill ran down her spine.

She finally came to her senses, the truth dawning on her. This was the world of the game she used to play—Toram. Or it should’ve been. The routes were the same, the environment familiar, but the landmarks—places like El Scaro—were gone.

Suddenly, a rustling sound broke her thoughts.
Rustle Rustle...**
Vanessa turned sharply to her side, her pulse quickening. There, amid the underbrush, was a small, plant-like organism, its shape resembling a flower. But it had eyes.
“Tulin.” She muttered, her mind flickering with recognition. She didn’t raise her guard. Her familiarity with it in the game made it seem harmless—low-level, a creature that wouldn’t normally pose a threat to any player, let alone a level-cap one like herself. Instead, it gave her a strange comfort—a reminder that something she recognized still existed. A proof that, at least, she was in a world she knew.

“It took a lot of items and time to reach this point...” she reminisced, her gaze lingering on the Tulin, still underestimating its danger. But then—
Whip clang!
The Tulin lashed out. Vanessa didn’t have time to react before the thick, vine-like limb of the creature cracked against her arm. The pain was unlike anything she had ever felt, searing through her body in waves of agony.

She crumpled to the ground, her vision blurred as she squirmed in the dirt. Her arm was bleeding, a long gash where the vine had struck her. Her breath came in ragged gasps, shock overtaking her as she clutched at her arm, trying to stem the blood.

Reality crashed down on her like a tidal wave. This wasn’t a game—there was no character to control. She was the character.

She screamed, the unrelenting pain coursing through her arm. The Tulin poised to strike again, its vine-like limbs about to whip toward her. Desperately, she scrambled backward, Instinctively her hands clawing at the ground trying to find either a weapon or a healing potion but alas there was none. 

Her chest tightened as the creature loomed over her. No escape. No hope. Shaking, she shut her eyes, bracing for the final blow.
Crunch.

The pain she braced for didn’t come. Instead, the sound of ripping fibers and splintering vines made her eyes snap open.

The Tulin lay before her, its severed body leaking green sap onto the grass. Towering just behind  it was a figure—white-haired, with skin pale as moonlight. Their black outfit, intricately laced with gold, glinted in the light. In their hand, a blade shimmered faintly, dripping with the plant’s green fluids.

She was in awe, but not because of how elegant or noble her savior appeared. No, it was because she recognized them. Her heart skipped a beat as she stared, wide-eyed. It was her.

The same face. The same equipment. Her first character from the game stood before her.

Vanessa’s gaze shifted downward. Her own body was clad in armor and gear she instantly recognized—equipment that belonged to her second character.
The savior’s golden eyes widened in equal shock, staring down at the injured figure on the ground. Realization dawned on their face.

“You’re my other character!” they both exclaimed in unison, pointing at each other in disbelief.

It didn’t make sense. By some strange anomaly, they were both the same person—but each existed as a different character from the eleven slots she had meticulously created in the game.

Vanessa’s lips parted as she tried to speak, her thoughts racing. “Hey, I have a questi—” Her words were cut short as a sharp jolt of pain shot through her arm, making her flinch and clutch at the wound.

Her savior’s expression hardened with concern. Without hesitation, they raised their hand, and out of thin air, a familiar object materialized—a Revita potion.

They knelt beside her, offering the glowing vial. “Drink this,” they said firmly.

Her savior raised a hand, and a glowing Revita potion materialized out of thin air. They offered it to Vanessa, who instantly recognized the item. Without hesitation, she took it and drank, desperate for relief. 

Warmth spread through her body the moment the liquid touched her tongue. Her wound closed almost instantly, the pain vanishing as if it had never existed. Vanessa glanced at her arm, her expression subdued. Probably due to the shock from everything—the attack, the pain, and now seeing her first character in the flesh—she barely reacted.

"Follow me," said Vanessa’s savior, her tone calm but firm.

Vanessa stood and followed without hesitation. As they walked, the two began talking, questions spilling out from both sides. It was almost surreal—because they were the same person, their questions mirrored each other. Each answered the other directly, their conversation flowing effortlessly until both were satisfied with the exchange.

Through their discussion, they established that the savior had awakened in this world first and had been living here for nearly a year before stumbling upon Vanessa. Both of them, however, shared the same strange gap in their memories—everything from their lives outside the game was hazy, except for the vivid recollection of playing the game itself.

With an unspoken understanding, they decided on names to distinguish each other. The savior, being the first to arrive in this world, would be called VanessaZERO or V0 (V-ZERO). The newcomer, Vanessa herself, would go by VanessaONE or V1 (V-ONE).

It was an odd compromise, but one that gave them a sense of structure amidst the chaos.

After walking for what felt like half an hour, V-ONE spotted a city in the distance. She squinted, her brows furrowing in confusion. The sprawling skyline was unfamiliar, something that should have been impossible.

With over 6,000 hours logged in the game, she knew every map by heart—every landmark, every hidden corner. But this city was a mystery.
“What is that city? Why can’t I recognize it?” V1 mumbled, her voice tinged with disbelief.
Beside her, V0 smirked knowingly, a glimmer of pride in her eyes. “Hoho, that’s Eldenbaum, in its full glory—the city we were never able to see it in the game.”

The words hung in the air, stirring memories in V1’s  mind. She vividly remembered Eldenbaum from the game, but not like this. In the game’s lore, it was a desolate ruin, destroyed long ago.
“Wait… wasn’t that city destroyed in the game’s lore?” V1 asked, her voice laced with hesitation.
V0 nodded, her expression lighting up with excitement. “Exactly! It was destroyed after the Cataclysm, right?”

“Yeah,” V1 replied slowly, the gears in her mind turning.
V0’s tone shifted, her excitement fading into a grim seriousness. “Here’s the thing V1, we are in the time before the Cataclysm happened and the gods are still complete and seated on their thrones.”
The weight of her words settled heavily between them.
“‘Yet,’” V1 repeated, her voice barely above a whisper.
V0 nodded, her gaze fixed on the distant city. “It will come. If what we remember from the game is correct, the Cataclysm is inevitable.”

“It took me a while to realize where I was when I first woke up in this world,” V0 began, glancing at V1 with a mix of amusement and dismay. “But at least I had it easier. I’m built as a tank, unlike you—a glass cannon. Seriously, a tulip almost killed you. That thing wouldn’t even leave a scratch on me.”
V1 rolled her eyes but didn’t argue, still mentally recovering from the earlier encounter.
“When I became aware of what was happening,” V0 continued, her tone growing serious, “I warned everyone I could. They didn’t believe me at first, but as a level-capped player with tier 5 skills, I was basically on par with the gods of this world. That’s all it took for them to start listening.”
She paused, her gaze hardening. “It’s been a year now. We’ve done everything we can to prepare for the fight against Coenubia. And now that you’re here, our chances are even better. There are two of us who know their weaknesses—and we’re as strong as the gods themselves.”
V1 met V0’s determined gaze, feeling the weight of her words sink in.
“I know you’re still shaken from earlier, but I need your help in this fight.” V0 extended her hand toward V1, her resolve clear.

V1 smirked faintly, shaking her head. “I’m you. You know exactly what I’m going to say.”
Both of them grinned, a sense of unity settling between them. Without hesitation, they shook hands, their shared resolve solidifying their bond.
They arrived at Eldenbaum, with V0 guiding V1 around the city. V0 knew that it would help her recover mentally—familiarizing herself with her surroundings, the people, and everything that had changed since her arrival. The two paid a visit to the gods to introduce V1, and V0 patiently taught her everything she wasn’t familiar with: skills, items, and combat techniques. They sparred whenever possible, pushing each other to grow stronger.
Despite the overwhelming complexity of this new world, the fact that V1 was built as a level-capped player focusing on agility and dexterity it took only a month for her to hold her ground in a sparring match, exchanging blows with gods and V0 alike.
“I never expected to see my glass cannon build in action in real life, let alone fighting with it,” V0 remarked with a tired laugh, both of them drenched in sweat from the sparring session. 
V1 wiped the sweat from her brow, her eyes sparkling with satisfaction. “A pale samurai clad in blue lamellar armor. I’m really thankful I took the time to work on my appearance too, instead of just focusing on damage. Otherwise, I’d be in mismatched outfits... and bald, at that.”

V0 opened her mouth to reply but was suddenly cut off. The ground shook violently beneath them, a tremor so powerful that the earth cracked, houses crumbled, and the very ground seemed to swallow everything in its path. But thanks to the extensive preparations made by Eldenbaum and the gods, the damage was kept to a minimum, with casualties being remarkably low.
“It’s here,” both V0 and V1 said in unison, their eyes fixed on the massive cracks in the earth. Crystals poured from the rifts, and in the sky above, the shapes of their awaited enemies—the Coenubia—began to emerge, their presence a dark omen. 
The Coenubia—a collective mind, a parasitic being—was a threat like no other. It attached itself to a host, taking full control of the body, turning and twisting it into a crystalline abomination. The urgency of the situation was clear, and without hesitation, both V0 and V1 sprang into action, each moving according to the plan they had already prepared for this moment.
V0, had already assembled a group of Eldenbaum’s mages. Their task was to make their way to meet Dunkelis and her army in the world of the dead. There, in that  realm, lay the Spring of Rebirth—the sacred power that ensured the full cycle of life and death. It was a cornerstone of the world’s balance. Without the Spring, life itself would cease to exist, the cycle of souls would shatter, and everything would fall into an eternal stasis. The Coenubia had its sights set on corrupting this vital power. V0’s team would need to hold the line and protect it, stopping the parasitic force before it could extinguish the Spring and unravel the entire cycle of life.
Meanwhile, V1 would remain behind to aid the city of Eldenbaum itself. She would join forces with the mages and knights to defend the city and its people. Thankfully, the preparation had paid off—thanks to their foresight, the mages had developed water-based skills, an essential tactic. The Coenubia’s greatest weakness was water. When struck by it, the parasitic entity would retreat from the host, disabling its control.
As V0 and V1 moved into position, the gods of this world took their own responsibilities. With a power beyond comprehension, they immediately set to work, repairing the cracks in the world that the Coenubia had caused and preventing the rift from spreading further. Some gods focused on mending the very fabric of reality, while others prepared to confront the most dangerous manifestations of the Coenubia—the ones that had fully corrupted their hosts, now turning into monstrous, unrelenting colossal crystal beasts.
The two places—The land of the dead and Eldenbaum—were the foremost targets of the Coenubia, each holding unparalleled significance. The realm of the dead, safeguarded the Spring of Rebirth, the foundation of the life cycle that ensured the perpetual flow of life and death. Without it, existence itself would collapse into stasis. On the other hand, Eldenbaum was home to technology far more advanced than anything even V0 and V1 could comprehend, surpassing the future they once knew. Should it fall into the Coenubia’s hands, it would become a devastating weapon, turning the city’s unmatched innovation into a massive part of the parasite’s unrelenting forces.
The stakes had never been higher, and failure was not an option. With their roles set and the gods holding the fort on the most dangerous fronts, there was no time to waste. The war between two worlds was about to begin.
The war raged on for weeks, and the meticulous preparations proved invaluable. The rifts were sealed, cutting off the influx of Coenubia reinforcements, and the tide of battle began to shift. The gods, especially those specialized in combat, took the offensive, striking at the Coenubia’s backlines while the remaining forces of Eldenbaum and Dunkelis held their ground. Victory seemed within reach—only vigilance and the eradication of the remaining Coenubia stood between them and the end of the war.
Days passed, marked by a tense silence. The gods kept watch from the skies, while V1 and Eldenbaum's forces scoured the forests for stragglers, ensuring no Coenubia could escape and reproduce in hiding.
One of the gods approached V1.
“We can handle things here. You should go and assist V0 in the land of the dead,” the god advised.
Understanding the urgency, V1 agreed and used a teleportation item to travel to the land of the dead. She arrived at the castle, where Dunkelis herself stood, visibly injured and weary.
“What happened?” V1 asked, her voice laced with concern.
Dunkelis winced but managed to speak. “Fully matured Coenubias attacked us. We barely fended them off. Then another one appeared, stronger than the rest. V0 pushed it outside the castle and fell alongside it, somewhere in the lower areas.”
V1 clenched her fists, worry gnawing at her. She knew she couldn’t heal Dunkelis, as potions didn’t work on gods, but she also knew Dunkelis would recover in time. Without hesitation, she dashed in the direction Dunkelis indicated. Reaching the cliff’s edge, she jumped, falling into the lower levels of the realm.
When she landed, her eyes locked onto the disintegrating remains of the mature Coenubia, its crystalline body fracturing and fading into nothingness. V0 stood in front of it, her back turned to V1. Relief washed over her.
“You made me worry for nothing,” V1 said, laughing breathlessly, her relief masking the tension she still felt. “Let’s go meet Dunkelis—she was injur—”
Her sentence cut off mid-breath as V0 turned to face her.
V1 froze. Her vision blurred, not from exhaustion, but from the tears welling in her eyes.
V0’s body was partially encased in crystal, spreading like a grotesque armor—a clear sign she had been parasitized.
“What... no...” V1 whispered, her voice trembling as the realization set in.
When the last mature Coenubia attacked, V0 had taken a desperate gamble to save Dunkelis. She banked on her 100% status ailment resistance as a tank to shield her from the parasite. But it hadn’t worked. This was no game—there were no mechanics or rules to rely on here. There was no respawn.
V1’s thoughts spiraled into chaos, racing to find a solution.

Throw her into a water source? The Mirror River is too far away and if she used a teleport the coenubia might resurface stemming from her.

Water magic from the mages? No, V0 could deflect it with her shield. Worse, she might attack the mages.

Could the status ailment resistance trait have partially worked? Too uncertain—approaching could mean death.

Killing V0 and reviving her? Impossible. They had no revival items left. V1, being a glass cannon, had exhausted their stock during her gameplay days. The shared inventory between them was empty.

Before she could think further, V0 lunged at her, shield and weapon raised. There was no mistaking it—the parasitization had taken full control.

V1 barely dodged the attack, her mind and heart in shambles as she faced the unthinkable.
The thought of killing V0—her savior, herself, her first friend, and what she considered family in this foreign world—was overwhelming. It weighed so heavily on her mind that it began affecting her fight. V0’s attacks started connecting as V1’s emotional vulnerability left her exposed.
Memories of their time together flashed before V1’s eyes, each moment growing sharper—their laughs, their victories, even the small, mundane exchanges that felt so distant now. Finally, her mind settled on one memory: the promise they had made before the battle. A solemn vow to each other that if one of them got parasitized, the other would end it.
A newfound resolve surged within her. V1 let out a fierce war cry, channeling all her turmoil into her blade as she prepared to fulfill the promise they had sworn. Her attacks became calculated and relentless, each strike chipping away at V0’s defenses. Being a tank, V0 wasn’t built for PvP, and V1’s precision gave her the upper hand. Finally, an opening presented itself, and without hesitation, V1 lunged, piercing V0’s heart.
V0 coughed, blood spilling from her lips, and the Coenubia disintegrated, leaving V0’s body behind.
“I hate promises. That’s what you’re thinking, huh?” V0 said with a faint, pained smile.
“STOP TALKING!” V1 shouted as she frantically poured potions over V0’s chest, even though she knew they wouldn’t work on a life-threatening injury.
“I’m sorry… for making you swear to that promise. It must’ve been so painful for you. Don’t… don’t blame yourself—” V0’s words broke off as another cough wracked her body, blood staining her lips again.
Her hand reached up, trembling, to caress V1’s tear-streaked cheek, leaving streaks of blood behind. V0 gave her one final smile before her hand fell lifelessly to her side.
“NO! NO! NO! COME ON, YOU’RE STRONGER THAN THIS!” V1 screamed, desperately shaking V0’s lifeless body. Her voice echoed as she clung to her, sobbing uncontrollably. Finally, though, reality sank in. Her cries softened into anguished whimpers as she gently laid V0’s body on the ground.
V1 wiped her tears and stood, preparing to leave. But just as she turned away, something struck her.
“Skill points… Tier 5 skills… On par with gods…”
Her eyes widened. She had an idea.
“USE BOOK OF OBLIVION!” she shouted, her voice breaking.
“ALL POINTS TO THE MAGIC TREE. PRIORITIZE ‘CHRONOS SHIFT.’”
The Book of Oblivion was a rare item that reset all skill points, allowing redistribution. In the magic tree, there was a Tier 5 skill named Chronos Shift, which consumed all mana. Its description hinted at turning back time, and in this world, the mechanics weren’t limited anymore—it could affect reality itself if one’s imagination was strong enough.
“EQUIP MAGIC DEVICE!” V1 roared.
Her mana flared uncontrollably as she used Chronos Shift. Every mana potion she had left was consumed, the overwhelming surge of energy tearing through her. Cracks spread across her skin like glass about to shatter, but she endured, holding onto V0’s body as tightly as she could.
“I won’t lose you. Never,” V1 whispered, her voice trembling but resolute.
Screaming through the excruciating pain, she activated Chronos Shift.
The world around her warped and twisted. Time itself unraveled, dragging everything backward to moments before V0’s sacrifice.
When the distortion cleared, V1 found herself back in the past, holding V0 close.
“Why are you hugging me?” V0 asked, confused as she glanced at V1’s tearful face.
V1 gasped, realizing she had succeeded. She quickly wiped her tears and smiled.
“ROARRR!” The mature Coenubia let out an enraged cry, drawing their attention.
Both V0 and V1 jumped into position, ready to fight.
“WHY ARE YOU USING A MAGIC DEVICE?” V0 yelled, noticing V1’s strange setup.
“DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT!” V1 replied with a smirk, determination burning in her eyes.
THE END
